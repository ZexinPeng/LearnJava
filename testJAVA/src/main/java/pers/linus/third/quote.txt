What if Christmas didn't come this year?
And no one paid for Christmas cheer.
Who would cry the biggest tear?
The child, or the store?

Why do brides wear virgin white?
Most do not reserve that right.
But to choose a color of their delight.
Would surely bring on the frowns.

To defy the laws of tradition.
Is a crusade only of the brave.
